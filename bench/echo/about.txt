These Benchmarks were done for each server running on 4 threads (4 processes in the case of Node)
1000 clients all send a frame of a particular size and wait for the same frame to be echoed back
from the server, doing that repeatedly for 90 seconds and 3 samples. QPS is the number of echos we receive from the server.
There are also benchmarks for fragmented frames as those are more expensive to process and reassemble into 
a complete message same rules as above but data is sent across multiple websocket frames each containing 4kb 
chunk of the data. 
a server that can quickly process complete frames faster than others,
DOES NOT mean that it can also optimally handle fragmentation as that
usually goes through a different less optimal code path, and this is why I also included fragmentation benchmarks
