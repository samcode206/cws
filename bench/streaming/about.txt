These benchmarks were run for each server on a single core and 128/8 clients reading and writing data as much as they can without waiting 
for an "echo" to be received before transmitting the next message, this help to test cases where clients are streaming large volumes of data and test how each 
server is able to handle memory build up/ backpressure. a server that did well in the echo /ping/pong style test doesn't mean it can do well in this type of benchmark
however it is not unrealistic for such payloads to occur in the real world, in fact echo benchmarks are fine but are more inline with a protocol such as http1.1 or other request response protocols.

streaming though is much much more memory intensive and including this as a separate test gives us much more context about a given server's performance under extremely high load.
it also gives us better context as to how efficient the library is in interacting with the underlying kernel, and the quality of it's buffered IO implementation. All servers were configured to be as close 
to each other as possible with each server's buffer size set to 512kb. All servers were running on a SINGLE core for better consistency of results. Each test also ran for 90 seconds with 3 samples taken.

the tests were conducted locally on 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-11900K @ 3.50GHz running Debian 12.
